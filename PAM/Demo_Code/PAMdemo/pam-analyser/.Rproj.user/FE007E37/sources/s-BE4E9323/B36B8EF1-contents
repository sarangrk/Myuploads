This problem is essentially balancing the risk of a possibly expensive unplanned failure with the cost of regular maintenance; with traditional methods money can be saved on regular maintenance often at the expense of a higher risk of failure. However, not all assets are the same and predicting which ones are the most likely to fail allows effort to be focused in the right place; this project aims to predict asset failures so that you can minimise costs and increase availability of your assets."),
