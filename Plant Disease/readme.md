## Introduction

We have tried to apply deep learning models to determine the health of a plant. We take a leaf and predict if it is healthy or have some specific disease, and the name of that disease. Our model is trained on 38 different categories, some of which are different diseases on same plant type.

## Key Benefits
* Early Disease Detection
* Always Available
* Limited Awareness & Resources
* Automatic Updates for New Disease Outbreaks

Our goal is to help farm owners predict the health of their plants accurately and in a timely fashion. Early and accurate discovery can help stop the spread of the disease and suggest possible preventive measures or urgent treatment. 

## Future Ideas
We are looking to enhance this app by including location specific information for weather patterns and make our predictions based on that. This, we believe, will enable farm owners detect the diseases well in advance, and make informed decisions.
